- My current focus is on Explainable AI, a rapidly growing field that seeks to make artificial intelligence (AI) more transparent and understandable to humans. As AI becomes more advanced and ubiquitous, it is important for us to be able to understand the reasoning behind the decisions made by these systems, especially in high-stakes applications like Cybersecurity, healthcare, and finance. By developing methods for explaining the inner workings of AI models, we can improve their reliability, reduce bias and discrimination, and increase trust in AI overall.
